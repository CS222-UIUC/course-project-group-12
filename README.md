This is a full stack interactive web application that was created primarily using React and Java. It displays crowd levels at different times at the dining halls of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. It was created with making receiving meals convenient for busy students in mind. On the page, it displays each of the dining halls at UIUC, and the user can select and interact with the dining hall of their choice in order to visualize the crowd at a specific time.
